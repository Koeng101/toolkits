# The Bacillus Formate Bioeconomy

Anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases has prompted massive investment in renewable energy, and is driving humanity towards becoming an energy abundant society. Eventually, renewable electricity will be a more efficient method than photosynthesis for capturing energy. Excess energy from renewable sources can be diverted towards production of molecules that can directly be used by microorganisms to produce useful products. 

One such molecule that can be used as a carbon and energy source for living organisms is formate. Formate can be efficiently produced using electricity with up to a [98% Faradaic efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c00122) and is even proposed as a [foundational molecule of the future bioeconomy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.07.005).

The process is simple: Excess energy from renewable energy sources is used to produce formate. This formate is then fed to microorganisms, which use the formate as a carbon source for biomass generation and for energy. These organisms can be used as fuels, feedstocks, or as factories for useful chemicals. In 2011, an [economic analysis of formate production]((https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201100220) put the electrical production of formate at ~$573 per ton (Fig 16.) with $558 of these dollars being spent on 7838kwhs of electricity necessary for conversion. Glucose costs approximately [$300-$400](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.07.005) per ton, with 3x the number of bonds available for energy. Formate becomes economically competitive with glucose when 1 ton of formate costs ~$100, or when 7838kwh costs ~$85, or when 1kwh costs ~1 cent. 

Solar is rapidly decreasing in price, with some estimates predicting the average price per kWh of solar in sunny parts of the world only costing [~1-2 cents by 2030](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/). Assuming no new technology is created to increase the efficiency of CO2 to formate conversion and assuming no carbon offset incentives, formate should be competitive with glucose for bioproduction within 10-15 years.

Bacillus subtilis is an important organism in the future bioeconomy for 3 reasons - natural competence, sporulation, and secretion. While natural competence lowers the skill necessary to work with genetic engineering, sporulation eliminates the need to have a -80c freezer for storage of strains, and Bacillus subtilis's efficiency in secretion allows for important biological molecules to be easily purified. The stability and distributability of Bacillus subtilis makes it the ideal chassis for decentralized bioproduction. 

I propose the synthesis of all genes necessary to make Bacillus subtilis a formatotroph (an organism who derives all energy and carbon from formate). This toolkit will include ~9 genes necessary for the biosynthetic pathway and ~6 deletion vectors for the verification of biosynthetic function.
