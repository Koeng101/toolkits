# The Bacillus Formate Bioeconomy

Anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases has prompted massive investment in renewable energy, and is driving humanity towards becoming an energy abundant society. Eventually, renewable electricity will be a more efficient method than photosynthesis for capturing energy. Excess energy from renewable sources can be diverted towards production of molecules that can directly be used by microorganisms to produce useful products. 

One such molecule that can be used as a carbon and energy source for living organisms is formate. Formate can be efficiently produced using electricity with up to a [98% Faradaic efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c00122) and is even proposed as a [foundational molecule of the future bioeconomy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.07.005).

The process is simple: Excess energy from renewable energy sources is used to produce formate. This formate is then fed to microorganisms, which use the formate as a carbon source for biomass generation and for energy. These organisms can be used as fuels, feedstocks, or as factories for useful chemicals. In 2011, an [economic analysis of formate production]((https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201100220) put the electrical production of formate at ~$573 per ton (Fig 16.) with $558 of these dollars being spent on 7838kwhs of electricity necessary for conversion. Glucose costs approximately [$300-$400](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.07.005) per ton, with 3x the number of bonds available for energy. Formate becomes economically competitive with glucose when 1 ton of formate costs ~$100, or when 7838kwh costs ~$85, or when 1kwh costs ~1 cent. 

Solar is rapidly decreasing in price, with some estimates predicting the average price per kWh of solar in sunny parts of the world only costing [~1-2 cents by 2030](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/). Assuming no new technology is created to increase the efficiency of CO2 to formate conversion and assuming no carbon offset incentives, formate should be competitive with glucose for bioproduction within 10-15 years.

Bacillus subtilis is an important chassis for the future decentralized bioeconomy because of some unique abilities the bacteria has, such [natural competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_competence), [sporulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporulation_in_Bacillus_subtilis), and [protein secretion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2006.08.002). Natural competence allows Bacillus subtilis to uptake DNA from its environment using biological machinery, simplifying the process of genetic modification. Sporulation allows Bacillus subtilis to become resistant to nearly all environmental conditions, [including exposure to the vacuum of space](https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-021783-3.50033-7), greatly simplifying storage of strains and freeing strain distribution from refrigerated cold chains. The protein secretion abilities of Bacillus subtilis make it an [widely used organism for industrial production of enzymes](http://doi.org/10.5772/29256), simplifying the process necessary to purify enzymes from expression strains. Bacillus subtilis has also been a [model organism](https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13043) for over ~20 years, with some researchers even investigating using Bacillus subtilis [as a chassis for minimal life](https://dx.doi.org/10.1128%2FMMBR.00029-16). 

As there is an increase in genetic engineering, it also becomes necessary to put into place biosafety mechanisms that prevent genetically engineered strains from being released and spreading into the environment. Previously, this has been done with [synthetic auxotrophies](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt840). A similar approach could be taken with [synthetic formate auxotrophy](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-0473-5) by knocking out sugar metabolism genes - creating an organism which is industrially viable, yet cannot survive in the natural environment. This ability is also reversible - it is unlikely environmental strains of bacteria, which may be harmful to humans, will be able to survive in formate-based media. Natural resistance to contamination makes formatotrophic strains even more attractive, especially as more people participate in genetic engineering.

For these reasons, I propose the synthesis of all genes necessary to make Bacillus subtilis a formatotroph. This toolkit will include ~9 genes necessary for the biosynthetic pathway and ~6 deletion vectors for the verification of biosynthetic function. Hopefully, this will enable the creation of a scalable, useful, and safe bacterial production platform for the future.
