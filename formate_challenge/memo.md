# The Bacillus Formate Bioeconomy

Anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases has prompted massive investment in renewable energy, and is driving humanity towards becoming an energy abundant society. Eventually, renewable electricity will be a more efficient method than photosynthesis for capturing energy. Excess energy from renewable sources can be diverted towards production of molecules that can directly be used by microorganisms to produce useful products. 

One such molecule that can be used as a carbon and energy source for living organisms is formate. Formate can be efficiently produced using electricity with up to a [98% Faradaic efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c00122) and is even proposed as a [foundational molecule of the future bioeconomy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.07.005).

The process is simple: Excess energy from renewable energy sources is used to produce formate at high efficiencies. This formate is then fed to microorganisms, which use the formate as a carbon source for biomass generation and as an energy source. These organisms can be used as fuels, feedstocks, or as factories for different useful chemicals. Although an [economic analysis of formate production](https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201100220) in 2011 put the electrochemical production of formate at ~$500 per ton, with glucose being 3x more efficient in oxidation and at a cost of only about $300-$400 per ton, advances in technology for producing formate and excess energy production will soon lower this price to where it competes or is a better molecule than glucose. 

Bacillus subtilis is an awesome organism in the future bioeconomy for 3 important reasons - natural competence, sporulation, and secretion. While natural competence lowers the skill necessary to work with genetic engineering, sporulation eliminates the need to have a -80c freezer for storage of strains, and Bacillus subtilis's efficiency in secretion allows for important biological molecules to be easily purified. The stability and distributability of Bacillus subtilis makes it the ideal chassis for decentralized bioproduction. 

There are 2 pathways to using formate to generate biomass in non-formate utilizing organisms - the [rubisco pathway](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.009), or the [reductive glycine pathway](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-0473-5). The rubsico pathway uses formate to power a non-native calvin cycle, while the reductive glycine pathway uses formate to synthesize glycine, serine, and pyruvate. The rubisco pathway's cycle creates a lot of intermediate metabolic products that are used in other pathways, while the reductive glycine pathway is more linear and easier to model. 

I propose the synthesis of all genes necessary to perform the formate reductive glycine pathway, optimized for Bacillus subtilis. This toolkit will include ~9 genes necessary for the biosynthetic pathway and ~6 deletion vectors for the verification of biosynthetic function.
