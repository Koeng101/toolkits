TL;DR: I think formate is going to be the future carbon base of the bioeconomy. Not only is it industrially scalable, but it gives a natural boundary between environmental and synthetic strains. This is especially important for widespread distribution of biological strains in the future, as more and more people are concerned with biosafety. Let's make Bacillus subtilis a formatotroph.
