# Synthesis plan

## How are the linkers getting synthesized?

In total, there are 192 linkers. Each linker's synthesis takes about ~87bp, and the minimal synthesis size for Twist fragments or Genparts are ~300bp, so I connected 4 linkers together in each ffragment to be synthesized, which makes there 48 fragments that need to be synthesized. 2 of the linkers in a fragment can be cloned out using BbsI, and the 2 others can be cloned out using BtgZI. In total, there will be 96 transformations, and each of the transformations will have a pool of 2 different linkers in them. I'll have to pick a few colonies to get single colonies of both linkers.

Each synthesis fragment is also flanked by the M13 forward and reverse primer sets, just in case I need to amplify a little bit more.
