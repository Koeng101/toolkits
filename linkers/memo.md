# The Linkers Collection

The Linkers Collection enables high-fidelity (~97%) assembly of many DNA parts (24) at once with GoldenGate assembly. Not only can you assemble transcriptional units, you can also assemble operons, and even reverse directionality in multi-gene constructs, all compatible with the widely used MoClo DNA standard.
